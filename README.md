# Mini test project from quatro
## created by Almog Attal

Few things to mention about the project:
1. I had some trouble finding a way to create custom error messages with joi on server side
2. I'm pretty sure there are better ways to make costum errors on client side
3. Removed node_modules folders from both sides to prevent the RAR from being heady

Hopefully what I did was enough to pass the test :)
